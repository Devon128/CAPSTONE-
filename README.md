# CAPSTONE-

# Week 1
We did a lot of research to see what we can use to make the right amount of freqeuncy we need in order to make this work. 
We also did a lot more research on groundhogs.

# Week 2 
More research on the frequency side of things, and planning our design.
# Week 3 
Did more research on the things we would need and talked to our mentor about some essential and non essential requirements. We drawed out some designs that we may use..


# Week 4
We picked a design we liked and started creating it on onshape. We are still trying to figure out what device or like components we need to create vibration.
We learned more about creating an frequency device and how much we will need in order to get the groundhogs or other pest to relocate. So as of right now we are moving in a prety good speed and are getting closer to our overall goal of creating a well put together freqeuncy machine. Next week we plan to continue to work on creating our prototype design and maybe starting to code.
# Week 5
We worked on creating our first frequency machine design in CAD. We had to decide rather our design was made correctly and it wasn't. So we had to go back and re-make it. We found out why our first box didn't really look right, we had made mistakes on the dimensions.
But other than that everything else went fine, we fixed our problem and are just cruising through our project. We also forgot that we may need to buy a vibration sensor. We still have to work on our coding part, not quite done with that.

# Week 6 
So we found out that we had to make some changes to our design, it was too small so we had to make it bigger by changing the height , width , length. We started coding and will continue to code next week. We are still trying to figure out if we should thicken the walls of our design in order to create the right sized holes for us to screw the walls together when it gets printed. We really don't have a plan , its more so just continuing to execute and keep this paste that we are moving at.


# Week 8 or 9 
Its a late update but we pretty much finished building the box and are currently making sure that are code is up to date and runs well and smooth. We took a while working on the box just trying to find out like how exatcly we should make it and how big we need it to be and also where we need to put the holes to screw the walls together. We chose to just put the walls together using brackets.


# Week 10 
We laser cutted our pieces out and started to put our box together. We have some code that works now but we still need a little tab bit more. Everything is going accordingly to plan as long as we stay on track and continue to work at the paste that we are working at right now and by continuing to strive for greatness.
# Week 12
We are still working on the code side of things, we're almsot fully done with our prototype. We also ran into a problem sort of kinda, we realized that our design is a little bit offset. So we have to make little fixes here and there when we start working on our final build.
# Week 13
We are still working on getting the code done and wiring , once done with the wiring we should be good to put the wired breadboard into our prototype for testing. we are constantly making progress and getting things done.

# Week 14 
This is our final edits on the design we chose. We had to fix the holes where the wire connects to our arduino in order for it to get plugged in. We are constanly getting closer to being done with our prototype.

# Last Week Of Feb. 
We spent most of our time working on the code and making changes that needed to be done.
We decided to focus more on the code so we could be finish with the prototype and make more changes if necessary.
We struggled a little with making our piezo buzzer stop beeping, and we had to pretty much re-learn the If statement. We also discovered that we had to relocate the holes that we made. 
Our plans for next week is to finish the code and laser cut our new updated pieces.

# Second Week Of March
We are still working on the code , we must fix it and make final adjustments to it and we should be done. Oh and we also have to  find a way to make space in our box to add a battery to power our arduino. 
# Third and Forth week of March
Finished the code , but still are making slight adjusments within it to clean it up a little. We must also measure how much space we have left in our box in order to add a battery and its holder. So far everything is coming along , and we love the progress and new skills that we're constantly picking up.
