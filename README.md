# CAPSTONE-

# Week 1
We did a lot of research to see what we can use to make the right amount of freqeuncy we need in order to make this work. 
We also did a lot more research on groundhogs.

# Week 2 
More research on the frequency side of things, and planning our design.
# Week 3 
Did more research on the things we would need and talked to our mentor about some essential and non essential requirements. We drawed out some designs that we may use..


# Week 4
We picked a design we liked and started creating it on onshape. We are still trying to figure out what device or like components we need to create vibration.
We learned more about creating an frequency device and how much we will need in order to get the groundhogs or other pest to relocate.
