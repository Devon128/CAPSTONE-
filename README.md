# CAPSTONE-

# Week 1
We did a lot of research to see what we can use to make the right amount of freqeuncy we need in order to make this work. 
We also did a lot more research on groundhogs.

# Week 2 
More research on the frequency side of things, and planning our design.
# Week 3 
Did more research on the things we would need and talked to our mentor about some essential and non essential requirements. We drawed out some designs that we may use..


# Week 4
We picked a design we liked and started creating it on onshape. We are still trying to figure out what device or like components we need to create vibration.
We learned more about creating an frequency device and how much we will need in order to get the groundhogs or other pest to relocate. So as of right now we are moving in a prety good speed and are getting closer to our overall goal of creating a well put together freqeuncy machine. Next week we plan to continue to work on creating our prototype design and maybe starting to code.
# Week 5


We worked on creating our first frequency machine design in CAD. We had to decide rather our design was made correctly and it wasn't. So we had to go back and re-make it. We found out why our first box didn't really look right, we had made mistakes on the dimensions.
But other than that everything else went fine, we fixed our problem and are just cruising through our project. We also forgot that we may need to buy a vibration sensor. We still have to work on our coding part, not quite done with that.
